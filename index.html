            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <!-- <p>
              I am a university student motivated to solve societal problems
              with the power of technology. My core competencies include a
              strong work ethic, a great attention to detail and teamwork.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My eagerness and passion for learning has led me to be well
              conversant with Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, WordPress, Git and
              GitHub despite being a non-IT student.
            </p>
            <br /> -->
            <p>
              During my extensive community involvement in the tech industry,
              especially as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, I have honed
              strong skills in <em>product advocacy</em>,
              <em>brand ambassadorship</em>, and
              <em>social media marketing</em>. Through my active involvement in
              this prestigious program, I have developed a deep understanding of
              Microsoft's products, allowing me to effectively advocate for
              their features, benefits, and value to diverse audiences.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am now seeking an opportunity to leverage and expand upon these
              skills in a professional setting, where I can contribute to a
              dynamic team and continue to enhance my expertise in product
              advocacy, brand ambassadorship, and social media marketing. My
              core competencies include a strong work ethic, a great attention
              to detail and teamwork.

            <p>
              As a university student, I struggle commuting to and fro
              university and moving between campuses. I felt that there has to
              be a better and convenient solution to this problem. So I decided
              to build Sycle City, a platform that facilitates bike sharing. I
              am working to make it a full working product.

              <h3>NUMBER GUESSING GAME</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
              A game where the computer picks a random integer between 1 and 100
              and the user has to guess what the number is. When the user
              guesses a number lower than the one the computer picked, the
              computer informs the user that the number is too low and the user
              has to guess again. When the user guesses a number higher than the
              one the computer picked, the computer informs the user that the
              number is too high and the user has to guess again. When the user
              guesses correctly, the user is told the guess is just right and
              the game terminates.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I'd like to implement a feature for awarding and tracking points.
              I'm also thinking of adding a 'Frenzy Multiplayer' feature which
              will support up to four players and the computer picks multiple
              random numbers in different rounds and the user(s) will try to
              guess them. Points are rewarded based on the accuracy of the guess
              and the user with the highest guess wins.

              I recreated the frontend of the PLP website getting inspiration

              I like tech articles since they always teach me something new. I
              love them so much I decided to start my own Python Blog at
              hashnode. But hey! Why use hashnode when I can create my own blog
              website? And create I did... or I still am. I am creating a
              website where I document my web development learning journey. It
              currently only has one blog but I'd like to populate it with more
              articles once I learn more web technologies.

              PLP Africa is non-profit organization that aims to empower one
              million youth with programming skills. I intern at PLP because
              their vision matches mine as I am also passionate about youth
              empowerment. In this role, I actively supported the Python module
              instructor in teaching students Python programming, ensuring a
              comprehensive and effective learning experience. Moreover, I took
              the initiative to redesign the Python course curriculum, enhancing
              its content and structure to better meet the needs of the
              students.

              One of my key responsibilities was managing a vibrant community of
              tech enthusiasts across five African countries: Kenya, Nigeria,
              South Africa, Zambia, and Tanzania. By fostering engagement,
              facilitating discussions, and organizing events, I successfully
              cultivated a sense of belonging and collaboration within the
              community. I encouraged knowledge sharing, facilitated networking
              opportunities, and provided mentorship to support the growth and
              development of the community members.
